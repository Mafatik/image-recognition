This is a Hopfield neural network for image recognition.

If you want to play with built version you should do all manipulations in /dist folder.

The image to recognize in raw data is a pseudo-graphical matrix with 0 -- white
and 1 -- black. You can add your own file to /data. /data/learn contains images
which neural network should be able to identify. /data/recognize contains images to recognition.
NOTE: all images must be the same size

If image has been recognized you'll see name of file from /data/recognize folder
and name of file from /data/learn folder that corresponds to the first one.

All images converts to pictures which you can found at /input_pictures
